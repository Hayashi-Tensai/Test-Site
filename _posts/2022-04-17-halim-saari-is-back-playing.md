Earlier this month, Selangor FC reported the return of midfielder Halim Saari to the Red Giants camp after fully recovering from an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury he suffered at the beginning of the 2021 season.

Halim has fully undergone team training with his teammates to regain his fitness and confidence back for him to return to play with them.

In addition, to help him get back into the rhythm of his game, Halim has been given the opportunity to participate in the Selangor FC 2 for the past two matches against Perak FC and PDRM FC yesterday.

For a start, he has played at least 45 minutes in both matches with the young players of Selangor FC 2.

The young players of Selangor FC were also excited to play with him. Halim has also, to some extent, helped the team to play more orderly throughout his time on the field.

Selangor FC is pleased with the progress shown byHalim Saari. Hopefully, he can get back to playing at his best of abilities and return to strengthen the Red Giants first team soon. All the best Halim!

Demi Kebanggaan!
