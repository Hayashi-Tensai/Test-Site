This season, the #RedGiants e-sports team will send 2 teams where the Selangor FC team will be represented by Kamil Al Amini and Husnain Hakim while the Selangor FC 2 team will be represented by Putera Sufrie and Alif Dani.

In contrast to the previous competition, MFL has given autonomy to each club in the Malaysian League to set up its own e-sports team and select qualified and suitable players to compete in virtual football matches using the FIFA22 Ultimate Team.

These two pairings will compete alongside 16 pairings from other teams according to the league format where the best 12 teams will advance to the Final Round using the knockout format. The champions at the league level will represent Malaysia and book slots to compete in the FIFA Global Series Playoffs organized by EA Sports and will bring home the tournament cash.

For the record of the previous achievement, Kamil or better known by the nickname ‘Maxnevis’ is currently ranked second in Malaysia based on the official FIFA rankings. He also emerged champion of the Malaysia eSports Series, PS South East Asia, and Northern eSports and was also in the Top 6 for the 2v2 FIFA Global Series Asia tournament.

While his partner, Husnain or also known as ‘Rainnn9’ is the champion of Malaysia eSports Championship (MEC), Top 2 for ESL Open Invitation, Top 4 Nivea Men Malaysia, and also Top 6 for the 2v2 FIFA Global Series Asia tournament.

Having participated in the ePiala Malaysia for 3 consecutive seasons previously, Putera has won the Selangor Xtiv Virtual eSports Championship, the Football Republic E-League Cup, and Selangor Football Day 2019 Championship. He also competed for the FGS South Asia qualifying round and represented Malaysia at Tag Heuer Virtual Bundesliga International Serie South East Asia.

Putera will team up with Alif Dani or also known by the nickname ‘Alif D’ who was once the Top 3 ePiala Malaysia 2022, emerged champion of the Keluarga Malaysia eSports Championship, made it to the Grand Final of SUKPAR FIFA22 and OOHAMI Cup.
